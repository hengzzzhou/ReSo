# ReSo Hyperparameter Configuration
# 
# This file contains hyperparameters for the ReSo multi-agent reasoning system.
# These parameters control agent selection, exploration behavior, and performance optimization.

[hyperparameters]
# Agent Selection Weights
# These weights determine the importance of different factors in agent selection

# similarity_weight: Weight for semantic similarity between target profile and agent expertise
# Higher values prioritize agents with more relevant expertise for the current subtask
similarity_weight = 0.6

# reputation_weight: Weight for agent's historical performance (reputation score)
# Higher values favor agents with better past performance
reputation_weight = 2.0

# cost_weight: Weight for agent's inference cost consideration
# Higher values penalize more expensive agents (currently used in cost penalty calculation)
cost_weight = 1.0

# Agent Selection Thresholds and Constraints

# THRESHOLD: Minimum similarity score threshold for agent selection
# Agents below this threshold are heavily penalized in selection
THRESHOLD = 0.4

# EXPLORATION_CONST: Exploration constant for Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) selection
# Higher values encourage more exploration of less-visited agents
# Lower values favor exploitation of high-performing agents
EXPLORATION_CONST = 0.3

# TOP_K: Number of top agents to select for multi-agent inference
# Higher values increase diversity but also computational cost
TOP_K = 1

# Training Configuration
[training]
# Maximum number of training episodes (can be overridden by command line)
max_episodes = 1000

# Frequency to save training checkpoints
save_frequency = 100

# Numerical error tolerance for answer comparison
error_tolerance = 0.15

# Performance Monitoring
[monitoring]
# Enable detailed performance logging
detailed_logging = true

# Log agent selection statistics
log_agent_stats = true

# Save performance plots
save_plots = true
