The answer is recorded as Answer[0]\\n', 'When the force on an object depends on the position of the object, we cannot find the work done by it on the object by simply multiplying the force by the displacement. The reason is that there is no one value for the force-it changes. So, we must find the work in tiny little displacements and then add up all the work results. We effectively say, \"Yes, the force varies over any given tiny little displacement, but the variation is so small we can approximate the force as being constant during the displacement.\" Sure, it is not precise, but if we make the displacements infinitesimal, then our error becomes infinitesimal and the result becomes precise. But, to add an infinite number of work contributions by hand would take us forever, longer than a semester. So, we add them up via an integration, which allows us to do all this in minutes (much less than a semester).\\n\\nForce $\\\\vec{F}=\\\\left(UNK_6(a constant calculated by adding the sum of Answer[0, 3] to the number (0.00). ) x^2 \\\\mathrm{~N}\\\\right) \\\\hat{\\\\mathrm{i}}+(4 \\\\mathrm{~N}) \\\\hat{\\\\mathrm{j}}$, with $x$ in meters, acts on a particle, changing only the kinetic energy of the particle.
